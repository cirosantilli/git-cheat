-   Short help: `git help`

-   List all commands: `git help -a`

-   Some guides:`git help -g`. General useful ones:

    - `man gitrevisions`: how to name revisions
    - `man gitrepository-layout`: what is inside `.git`
    - `man gitglossary`: index of Git terms

-   Help for a command: `git add --help`. Same as `man git-add` or `man git add`.

-   Official source code:

        git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git

    Official read only mirror on GitHub:

        git clone https://github.com/git/git

    In particular, the `Documentation` directory contains no only the source for the man pages, but also many tutorials and internals information which are not present in the man pages.

    - `Documentation/technial`: internals
    - `Documentation/howto`: tutorials

-   <https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page>

    Official wiki.

-   Issues, questions and patches are sent by email at: <git@vger.kernel.org>

    You subscribe by sending an email to <majordomo@vger.kernel.org>, but it is around 100 posts / day!

    There are web interfaces subscribed that store old threads.

    -   the most popular and often linked to as the canonical URL seems to be: <http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git> but as a millennial I find it really hard to navigate.

    -   <http://git.661346.n2.nabble.com/> is a more usable option

    TODO: what is `vger`? Is it a Star Trek reference: <http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/V%27ger>? Would make some sense as in the Star Trek canon it is the name of an entity which aims to absorb as much knowledge as possible.

-   Tutorials from companies who make money from Git:

    -   <http://git-scm.com/book>.

        Apparently GitHub maintained but officially adopted by Git: <https://github.com/blog/1125-new-git-homepage>

        Good info and graphs.

        Leaves out many practical things.
